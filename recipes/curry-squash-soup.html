        <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place butternut squash in a baking dish, flesh side up. Brush 1 tablespoon 
                    melted butter over the flesh and top with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon 
                    pumpkin pie spice, and cayenne pepper.</li>
                <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tender, about 1 hour. Remove squash from 
                    oven and cool for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place a large stockpot over medium heat; add 1 tablespoon butter. Cook and 
                    stir onion in the melted butter for 2 minutes. Add curry powder; cook and 
                    stir for 1 minute. Stir in coconut milk; bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Scoop flesh from the butternut squash and add to coconut milk mixture; mix 
                    in remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, vegetable 
                    stock, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and 
                    simmer until soup is heated through.</li>
                <li>Blend soup using an immersion blender on low speed. Simmer until soup is 
                    smooth and thickened, about 20 minutes more. Add more vegetable stock for 
                    a thinner consistency and season with salt.</li>
                <li>Ladle soup into bowls and top each with pumpkin seeds and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
            </ol>
