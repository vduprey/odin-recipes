                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dark sesame oil</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
                <li>1 pound sushi-grade ahi tuna, cubed</li>
                <li>½ cup cucumber - peeled, seeded, and diced</li>
                <li>2 medium green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 large avocado, diced</li>
                <li>½ tablespoon black sesame seeds, lightly toasted</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine rice and water in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. 
                    Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes 
                    (do not uncover while cooking.) Remove pan from heat and let stand, covered, for 
                    10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While rice stands, combine 2 tablespoons vinegar and sugar in a small microwave-safe 
                    bowl; microwave on high until boiling, 30 to 45 seconds. Stir mixture with a whisk until 
                    sugar dissolves. Add cream cheese and 1/2 teaspoon salt to bowl, stirring with a whisk to 
                    combine. Gently fold vinegar mixture into rice using a rubber spatula; let stand for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Generously coat 12 muffin cups with cooking spray. Lightly coat each of 12 (5-inch 
                    square) parchment paper pieces with cooking spray; press paper squares into muffin cups 
                    to form a liner. Using moistened hands, press rice mixture evenly along bottom and sides of 
                    muffin cups (about 2 1/2 tablespoons rice per cup). Refrigerate for 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine remaining 2 teaspoons vinegar, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, soy sauce, 
                    sesame oil, and red pepper in a medium bowl, stirring with a whisk. Add tuna, 
                    cucumber, green onions, and avocado to bowl. Toss gently to combine.</li>
                <li>Divide tuna mixture evenly among rice cups; sprinkle evenly with sesame seeds. Gently remove 
                    cups from pan by lifting parchment paper edges.</li>
            </ol>
